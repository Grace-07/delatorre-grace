// Activity: Exploring Common JS Built-in Methods

// Objective: Practice using common JS built-in methods to perform various operations.

// Instructions:
// 1. Create an HTML file with a heading that says "Common JS Built-in Methods".
// 2. Create a JavaScript file and link it to the HTML file.
// 3. In the JavaScript file, you will find comments describing different tasks that need to be performed using common JS built-in methods. Your task is to write the code to complete these tasks.
// 4. The tasks to be completed are as follows:
//    a. Calculate the square root of a given number.
//    b. Generate a random number between 1 and 10.
//    c. Convert a string representation of a number to an actual number.
//    d. Check if a value is not a number.
//    e. Convert a number to a string.

// Note: Read the comments carefully to understand the requirements for each task. Use the appropriate method to accomplish the given task.

// Good luck!

// Your code implementation goes here:

// Calculate the square root of a given number
console.log("Calculate Square Root: ", Math.sqrt(234));

// Generate a random number between 1 and 10
console.log("Generate random numbers: ",  Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1);

// Convert a string representation of a number to an actual number
console.log("Convert String to Number: ", parseInt("1234"));

// Check if a value is not a number
console.log("is a not number? ", isNaN("Hello"));

// Convert a number to a string
console.log("Convert Number to String: ", (1234).toString());
